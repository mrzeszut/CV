# Summary

I am a scientist who wants to learn and discover the processes and phenomena of the earth's atmosphere. Air is one of the basic components of the environment, without which there is no life on earth. 5 minutes without oxygen causes irreversible changes in our brain, so I believe that my area of interest is very important. I hope that my work will contribute to the understanding of a small part of the surrounding world. It will allow to plan effective air protection engineering activities.\
\

**Major Research Topics:**

-   **Parameterization and accuracy assessment of air quality modeling systems** - My research will allow the effective use of these techniques for regulatory purposes.

-   **Analysis of air quality monitoring system data** - I am developing and testing different methods to identify how individual factors determine air quality.

-   **Air quality monitoring** - I am working on calibration algorithms for low-cost particulate matter sensors that will be robust to changing locations.

-   **Creating tools for environmental engineers in R** - In my free time, I create the *"mpsenvi"* package that will perform accuracy assessment, data preparation, modeling, and visualization of results from air quality models.
